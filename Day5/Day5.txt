#include<iostream>
using namespace std;

class B{
    public:
        void Addition();
};
class A{
    int x,y;
    friend void B::Addition();
};
void B::Addition(){
    A ob;
    cout<<"Enter Two Numbers";
    cin>>ob.x>>ob.y;
    cout<<"Addition: "<<ob.x+ob.y;

int main(){

}

This is a Program for a friend class, here we have to declare the freind class first like Class B.
Friend Function: Only a Function can access the data of Friend Class.
Friend Class: The Whole Class can able to access the private members of the Friend Class.

Class Members:
    1. Data Members.
        a. Static Member
        b. Non-Static Member
    2. Member Functions.
        a. Static Member Function
        b. Non-Static Member Function

Functions vs Methods 
1. Methods are the functions declared inside the class
2. Methods have access tho the objects
3. Methods have Access Rights ie Public Private and protected.

Static Data Members OR Class Variables
Non Static Data Members or instance Variables

Diffrence between static and non static data members or Class variables or instance variables.
1. static data members are common for all objects and non static data members are individual for every object.
2. When we create a instance of a class the static member dosent allocate Memory but Non-Static member get memory allocated when the object is created.
3. Static members are accessed by using class name along with sro(scope resolution) operator and non static data members are accesed with the help of object.
4. When Class Loads the non static gets memory allocated but when program loads the static gets memory allocate.
5. Static Data members gets memory when program is Loaded in memory
6. Whenever we create a static variable inside a class we have to declare it outside the class to tell the compiler about the static data member 
7. Once the Value is allocated to the static data member all the object gets the same value for the static vatiable.

Example: 
#include<iostream>
using namespace std;
class Test{
    public:
    int ID;
    string name; //Non- static data member
    static string clgname; //staic data member
};
string Test::clgname;
int main(){
    Test ob1,ob2,ob3,ob4;
    ob1.ID;
    ob1.name="Amit";
    ob2.name="Rajat";
    ob3.name="Virat";
    ob4.name="Aakash";
    cout<<ob1.name<<endl;
    cout<<ob2.name<<endl;
    cout<<ob3.name<<endl;
    cout<<ob4.name<<endl;
    ob1.clgname="MIET";
    // ob2.clgname="GCET";
    cout<<ob1.clgname<<endl;
    cout<<ob2.clgname<<endl;
    cout<<ob3.clgname<<endl;
    cout<<ob4.clgname<<endl;
    return 0;
}

Write program to create a class that restrict users to create multiple objects. (if user create multiple objects all the objects points to a same memory location.)


a. Static Member Function and Non-Static Member Function
1. both static and non static member functions are common for objects.
2. Static function can access only the static members of the class directly but it cannot access non static members directly
3. static function are accessed by class name and non static are accessed by object name.

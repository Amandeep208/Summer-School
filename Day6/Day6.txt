Polimorphism
--> polymorphism means many forms.
--> Polymorphism is of two types 
    -> Compile Time Polymorphism. (Static or Early Binding)
    -> Run Time Polimorphism. (Dianimic or late Binding)

Compile time Polymorphism:- When an object is bound to its function call is is called compile time polymorphism.
                            It is also known as early Binding or static Binding
        For Example:- 1. Function Overloading
                      2. Operator Overloading
    
Function Overloading:

#include<iostream>
using namespace std;
class Output{
    public:
        void print(char ch){
            cout<<ch;
        }
        void print(int ch){
            cout<<ch;
        }
        void print(string ch){
            cout<<ch;
        }
        
};
int main(){
    Output ob,ob1,ob2;
    ob.print('A');
    ob.print("man");
    ob.print(2003);
    return 0;
}

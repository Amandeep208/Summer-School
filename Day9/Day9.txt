Dynamic MEmory Allocation
--> DMA is refers to preforming memory allocation by a mrogrammer.
--> Dynamically allocate memory is allocated on Heap, and non static and local variables get memory allocated in stack.
--> To preform dynamic allocation in C++ usinf function of C language like mallco(), Calloc() etc as well as they provide two operator new and delete,
that preform the task of allocating and free in the memory in better and easy way.

NEW OPERATOR:
-->The new operator denotes a request for memory for memory allocation on the Free store. IF sufficent memory is available, a new operator initalize the 
memory and returns the address of the newly allocated and initialize memory to the pointer 

        Syntax: pointer-variable = new data-type;

-->We can also use the operator to initialize value or create a memory block:

        pointer-variable = new data-type(value)


#include<iostream>
using namespace std;

int main(){
    int *ptr = new int;  //initialiizing nwe pointer variable with data type int
    *ptr = 100; // allocating value 100 to the pointer variable
    cout<<*ptr<<endl; //printing value

    int *ptr1 = new int[5]; // initializing an array
    for (int i=0;i<5;i++){
        cin>>ptr1[i];
    }
    for (int i=0;i<5;i++){
        cout<<ptr1[i]<<"\t";
    }
    cout<<endl;
    //another way of printing
    for (int i=0;i<5;i++){
        cout<<*(ptr1+i)<<"\t";
    }
    return 0;
}

if we are goint to preform increment and decrement on a pointer type of variable it is based on scale factor, (length of data type).

-->After Deleting the poiner the pointer points to a location called as danging pointer.
